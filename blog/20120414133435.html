  [asin: 4774139289:detail]
</p>
<p>
  This book seems to be the only CGI book written in modern Perl at this time. Most Perl books about CGI contain a lot of less recommended descriptions from the time Perl 4 was all the rage.
</p>
<p>
  It seems unlikely that CGI books are written with modern Perl in mind.
</p>
<p>
  The explanation of CGI is not about the details of the protocol, but it is an explanation that makes it easy to imagine what will be done internally when developing a Web application using the CGI protocol. ..
</p>
<p>
  The explanation is such that you can understand the flow of "browser->HTTP request issuance->web server->CGI script->HTTP response generation->web server->browser".
</p>
<p>
  CGI itself is no longer mainstream because it's slow, but I think it's useful as a help in understanding how web applications work.
</p>
<p>
  It also explains in detail the part where CGI is placed and actually executed on Sakura's rental server. The explanations such as FFFTP are also polite, and when actually deploying CGI on the server, consideration is given to avoid tripping as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
  This book contains a pure "Introduction to Perl" with rounded chapters. This chapter has nothing to do with CGI scripts, so you can read it as an introduction to modern Perl. The second chapter of Perl, which is useful for business, explains the basics of Perl, but I think it would be easier to imagine if you think that this is explained carefully.
</p>
<p>
  Also, <a href="http://gihyo.jp/book/2009/978-4-7741-3928-9/support">download</a> the sample code used in this manual from the Web. You can also try it.
</p>
<p>
  Since this is my first work, there are quite a few typos and many typographical errors.
</p>
<h3> Challenge the web framework </h3>
<p>
  The technique of writing web applications with CGI scripts is now obsolete. Let's challenge a web application using a web framework.
</p>
<p>
  Easy programming I rewrote the web application sample published in CGI/Perl with a framework called Mojolicious.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/blog/20100109126494.html">A word message board (Mojolicious::Lite version)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/blog/20100113126494.html">Image board (Mojolicious::Lite version)</a>
  </li>

    <a href="/blog/20100115126494.html">Simple search application (Mojolicious::Lite version)</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3> Easy programming CGI/Perl errata </h3>
<p>
  We have created an errata for "Easy Programming CGI/Perl". It describes what you discovered and what you were told. It contains a lot of mistakes. I think most of the sample code works.
