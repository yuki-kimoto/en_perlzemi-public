<h2><a href="/blog/20091105124627.html"> Time::Piece - A new way to handle dates and times </a></h2>
<p>
  Starting with Perl 5.10, a module called Time::Piece has been added to the standard module to handle time conveniently. If you're using Perl 5.10 or higher, the Time::Piece module is useful if you want to work with dates and times.

<p>
  In traditional Perl, standard modules didn't have an intuitive way to handle dates and times. It took a little tedious work to handle dates and times. Time::Piece provides intuitive manipulation of dates and times. It also has a date/time formatting function and an analysis function.
</p>
<p>
  Perl has a module called DateTime, which is essentially the standard for date-handling modules. However, this module must be installed from CPAN, not the standard module. Also, since it is a huge module, it takes a lot of time to load the module. You may be a little dissatisfied with the execution speed except in an environment where modules can be expanded in memory such as mod_perl.
</p>
<p>
  Think of Time::Piece as a fast, lightweight module with some functionality.
</p>
<p>
  For general information on dates and times, please refer to the following.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/blog/20161123147990.html">Handling dates and times in Perl</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3> Acquisition of time/date information </h3>
<p>
  Use the Time::Piece module as follows: When used, the Time::Piece module overwrites the core localtime and gmtime.
</p>
<pre>
use Time::Piece;

# Get Time::Piece object
my $t = localtime;

# Get date and time information
my $year = $t-&gt;year;
my $month = $t-&gt;mon;
my $mday = $t-&gt;mday;

my $hour = $t-&gt;hour;
my $minute = $t-&gt;minute;
my $second = $t-&gt;sec;
</pre>
<p>
  You can get the Time::Piece object by calling localtime, and you can get the date and time information from now on.
</p>
<p>
  The case where the time information is acquired by the standard function localtime is described for comparison.
</p>
<pre>
# When time information is acquired by localtime of standard function
my ($second, $minute, $hour, $mday, $month, $year) = localtime;

# Month starts from 0, so add 1
$month += 1;

# Year is obtained by subtracting 1900, so add 1900
$year += 1900;
</pre>
<p>
  It is more intuitive to use localtime of Time::Piece to handle date and time information.
</p>

<h3> Judgment of date </h3>
<p>
  You can use Time::Piece to determine if it is a leap year and if it is the last day of the month.
</p>
<pre>
# Is it a leap year?
$t-&gt;is_leap_year

# Get the last day of the month (return the number 28-31)
$t-&gt;month_last_day
</pre>
<h3> Format date/time </h3>
<p>
  You may want to format the date/time and output it. Time::Piece provides several fixed formats. You can also format it freely using the strftime method.
</p>
<h4> [A] Formats provided by default </h4>

<h4> [B] Format customization </h4>
<p>
  If you want to customize the format freely, use the strftime method. Specify the time representation in $format.
</p>
<pre>
$t-&gt;strftime($format)
</pre>
<p>
  This is a sample format of date and time.
</p>

</pre>
<p>
  A list of formats that can be used with strftime.

<h4> Precautions when handling Japanese </h4>
<p>
  Note that Time::Piece's strftime method always returns a byte string, whether the input is a byte string or an internal string.
</p>
<pre>
# Byte string is always returned
my $bytes = $tp-&gt;strftime("%Y year%m month");
</pre>
<h3> Parse the character string that expresses the date/time </h3>
<p>
  You can parse date and time representations to create Time::Piece objects. Use the strptime method to parse dates and times.
</p>
<pre>
my $t = Time::Piece-&gt;strptime(character string representing date/time, format);
</pre>
<p>
  As a sample, let's parse the MySQL date representation and create a Time::Piece object. Use the above strftime format for the format.
</p>
<pre>
my $datetime_mysql = '2009-12-31 23:59:59';
my $t = Time::Piece-&gt;strptime($datetime_mysql, '%Y-%m-%d%H:%M:%S');
</pre>
<h3> Localization </h3>
<p>
  By default, month and week names are in English. If you want to get the Japanese week name, pass an array of day names to the method to get the week name.
</p>
<pre>
my @week_names = ('Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat');
my $t = Time::Piece::localtime;
# Get week name in Japanese
my $wday = $t-&gt;wdayname(@week_names);
</pre>
<h3> Calculation of date/time information </h3>
<h4> Tempe::Piece object subtraction </h4>
<p>
  Time::Piece can also calculate dates and times. If you subtract between Time::Piece objects, the return value will be a Time::Seconds object. This object is in seconds when evaluated as a string.
</p>
<pre>
my $sec = $t2- $t1;
</pre>
<p>
  You can also convert Time::Soconds objects to days and years.
</p>
<pre>
$sec-&gt;seconds;
$sec-&gt;minutes;
$sec-&gt;hours;
$sec-&gt;days;
$sec-&gt;weeks;
$sec-&gt;months;

# 30 days
$sec-&gt;financial_months;
</pre>
<p>
  The conversion to days and years is done according to the following rules. One day is converted to 24 hours. One week is converted to 7 days. One year is converted to 365.24225 days. One year is converted to 12 months.
</p>
<h4> Addition of Time::Piece objects </h4>
<p>
  Time::Piece objects cannot be added to each other. You can add seconds or a Time::Seconds object to the Timpe::Piece object.
</p>
<pre>
$t + 533;
$t + Time::Seconds-&gt;new(300);
</pre>
<p>
  Time::Seconds also provides constants that can be added to the Time::Piece object.
</p>
<pre>
ONE_DAY
ONE_WEEK
ONE_HOUR
ONE_MINUTE
ONE_MONTH
ONE_YEAR
ONE_FINANCIAL_MONTH
LEAP_YEAR
NON_LEAP_YEAR
</pre>
<p>
  To add 5 days: The Time::Seconds module must be loaded to take advantage of these constants.
</p>
<pre>
use Time::Seconds;
$t + ONE_DAY * 5
</pre>
<h3> Date comparison </h3>
<p>
  You can use comparison operators to compare dates. You can use "<", ">", "<=", " >= ", "<=>", "==" and " != " .
</p>
<pre>
$t1 &lt; $t2
</pre>
<h3> Create Time::Piece object </h3>
<p>
  As far as I read the document, it seems that there is no choice but to use the strptime method to create a Time::Piece object at any date and time.
</p>
<pre>
my $t = Time::Piece-&gt;strptime('2009-12-31 23:59:59', '%Y-%m-%d%H:%M:%S');
</pre>
<p>
  (When I read the source code, there is a parse method, but when I tried it, it seems to be broken ... It seems that it is private because it is not in the document.)
</p>
<h3> Get an object that represents today's date </h3>
<p>
  To use the <strong> Time::Piece </strong> module to get an object that represents today:
</p>
<pre>
use Time::Piece;

my $today = today ();

sub today {
  # Today (YYYY-mm-dd HH: MM: SS)
  my $today_
